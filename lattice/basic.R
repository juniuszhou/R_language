# lattice is other library for graph. it is based on grid. 
# grid is low level implementation and low leverl api.
# usually, we don't use grid directly. 
# different with basic graph system, which draw the graph while running method.
# lattice and grid just get an object, which can be executed by print. then we
# can see the graph. but if the object not referenced by any variable. just
# print it immediately, that is why we can see it after run a method like basic graph.
